            <p>My first week of web developing is coming to an end and boy oh boy has it been 
            eyeopening.</p>

            <p>It wasn't until I opened up all the course material that it occurred to me that 
            I didn't actually understand a single aspect of what was in front of me.<br>

            So after quickly scrolling through the information about the week's assignment, 
            I had to kindly close everything down as I felt the infamous " action paralysis"
            creeping up on me.</p>

            <p>However, every day I would open up the computer, things seemed to get less 
            daunting.</p>
